### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Having years of experience creating products for developers and recent one on supporting community of developers as a Product Manager, Iâ€™m excited to replicate these successes with Spotify. Being long-term Spotify user it feels special to be a part of a right company!

Community building, growing and harnessing is a fantastic job product-wise (in IndyRiot I was a part of community product development). Itâ€™s even more exciting if itâ€™s a developers community as itâ€™s something very close to my previous experience:

- At Diligences ([https://diligences.com](https://diligences.com/)) software developers weâ€™re main users of our products and the main stakeholders as I used Product-Led Growth (PLG) framework to drive onboarding, adoption and retention.
- At CKAN ([https://ckan.org](https://ckan.org/)) core development team drives maintenance and development of the platform (https://github.com/ckan). As a Contributing Product Manager I facilitated alignment, created vector via buy-in and worked on easier accessibility of the project for developers.

Leading the product for me goes through a process of formulating or evolving product vision that influences product strategy that defines product roadmap. I have experience managing this cycle in full adding GIST framework to combine agile software development, OKRâ€™s and flexibility in target settings.

Product portfolio management started for me early on, with Warleigh Marketing where it was a portfolio of 4 online dating websites 10 years ago. Recently at Diligences I managed a portfolio of 2 internal and 6 business product (ones with UI). Actually I was managing 3 teams, one of which consists of 2 product managers to take better care of 8 products we had).

Data-driven product development in Diligences (company I co-founded) was about gathering quantitative metrics around feature usage or doing research before the feature is implemented. This approach helped finding out opportunities for improvement within the product and communication of it.

Iâ€™m a people person as feedback that I received from engineers, designers, data scientists, marketers who worked with me is about a good atmosphere that I always try to create and maintain and dynamic environment where delivering and growing personally go hand in hand.

I love to communicate complex topics with simple words and understandable, relatable stories. Got 2 trainings for public speaking from Dale Karnegie Norway and a public speaking coach in Kharkiv. Speaking 5 languages to some extent, helps in formulating thoughts in the most universal way and have a large selection of stories for different cultural contexts.
